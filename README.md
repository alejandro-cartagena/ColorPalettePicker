## About Color Palette Picker

Used The Color API (https://www.thecolorapi.com/) to fetch an array of color objects based on the user's
selection on the color wheel. The user can specify for different palettes from the selected color. When
the user clicks on a color from the palette, it is copied to their clipboard and a message is displayed,
letting the user know that the hex code has been copied.
